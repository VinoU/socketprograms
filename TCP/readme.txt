This socket program demonstrates an SFTP (Simple File Transfer Protocol) using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). The server and the client establish a connection, and then the client sends the text file to the server.

How to run the program:
Step 0: Make sure thereâ€™s a text file in the same directory with the client file
Step 1: compile both the server and the client programs: gcc -o server server.c  gcc -o client client.c
Step2: Start off the server with ./server <port#>
Step3: Start off the client with ./client <input_filename> <output_filename> <server_ip_address> <server_port>
Step4: The both program terminates, a new file with he output_filename should appear in the same directory with the server program, and its content is same with that in the input file.
